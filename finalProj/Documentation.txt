Audience: Professionals in the creative industry, specifically those looking to hire. Anyone who wants to see my work.
Most people would probably view my site from their laptop or desktop, occasionally on their phone.

I decided to go with a brutalist take on my portfolio design simply because I am bored with the "cookie cutter"
website trends that are happening right now. They work, any maybe better than my site, but at least mine is interesting
and different.

All of my content was created by myself, except for the jquery I used for the drop down menu, that I took from the 
practice practical. - I modified it to contain my links and look more appropriate on my page.

Since the first iteration of this project I have fixed the grid to be more uniform and put together. I have also 
added jquery for the new drop down menu, and I have re-made all of the pages to be unique and funtional for both a 
desktop or a mobile device.
